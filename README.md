# Mit python course

These are the psets that I did on the free mit curriculum. They are here to show my workings towards this challenge I have taken unto myself.
Here is the link to the free mit course.
echo "# mit-python" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/mamofthecoder/mit-python.git
git push -u origin main
